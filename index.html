    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Design a social-first campaign that connects everyday college moments
      (studying, interviewing, presenting) with L’Oréal products that help students feel confident and polished.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Insight:</strong> Gen Z sees beauty as part of identity and career energy, not vanity.
      They want routines that are fast, affordable, and “polished enough” for real life.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Strategy: “Polished Enough” Positioning</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Show simple routines that take 5–10 minutes and use only a few staple L’Oréal products.</li>
      <li>Focus on real student scenarios: 8AM midterm, club presentation, on-campus interview, part-time job.</li>
      <li>Use TikTok & IG Reels to share GRWM and “confidence hacks” content with honest, low-pressure tone.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Content Pillars:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>GRWM x Academics:</em> “Get Ready With Me for my supply chain exam.”</li>
      <li><em>Career Confidence:</em> “10-minute interview look using only 3 L’Oréal products.”</li>
      <li><em>Real Student Stories:</em> quick clips of students sharing how small routines help them feel prepared.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Supply Chain & Information Systems Angle:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use social listening (views, saves, comments like “I need this”) to flag high-demand SKUs in student markets.</li>
      <li>Recommend priority SKUs (e.g., concealer, mascara, tinted serum) for campus-area retailers and drugstores.</li>
      <li>Propose a simple “micro-replenishment” model: increase safety stock for top SKUs in locations with strong social engagement.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why it’s in my portfolio:</strong> This case study shows how I combine
      brand storytelling with SC&IS thinking—linking content performance to demand patterns and smarter inventory decisions.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:0.9rem;">
      I feature this case study when applying to L’Oréal and other large beauty/CPG companies
      that care about both brand and operations.
